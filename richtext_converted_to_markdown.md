Of course. Here is a comprehensive README that summarizes the project's objectives, the problems it solves, and the business logic implemented in our database design.

Online Food Ordering Database
=============================

1\. Overview
------------

The purpose of this database is to maintain the data for a suite of online food ordering applications. 1It serves as a central system for an application that acts as an interface between customers and restaurants. 2The database includes functionality for Browse restaurants and menus, filtering by various criteria, placing orders, managing deliveries, and processing payments. 3

2\. Business Problems Addressed
-------------------------------

This database is designed to solve several key business problems:

3\. Core Objectives
-------------------

The primary objectives of this database are to effectively maintain, search, track, and report on all key entities within the food delivery ecosystem. This includes:

*   **Data Management:** Maintaining data on customers, addresses, restaurants, menus, cuisines, orders, deliveries, and payments. 7777777777777777
    
*   **Search & Filtering:** Performing detailed searches for restaurants, menu items, and orders, with filtering based on criteria like cuisine and ratings. 8888
    
*   **Status Tracking:** Providing real-time tracking for order and delivery statuses. 9
    
*   **Reporting:** Generating reports on all major entities to provide actionable business intelligence. 10101010
    

4\. Business Logic & Solution
-----------------------------

The database is built on a set of core business rules, such as customers placing multiple orders, restaurants having many food items, and each order being assigned a single delivery agent. 11 The following logic is implemented to address the project's requirements:

### User & Role Management

*   **Unified User Profile:** To provide a seamless experience, the database uses a "Single User, Multiple Roles" model. A single person creates only one account and is assigned different roles (e.g., 'Customer', 'Branch Manager', 'Delivery Agent'). This avoids forcing users to create multiple accounts and provides better analytics.
    

### Restaurant & Menu Management

*   **Brand and Branch Model:** The design distinguishes between a **Restaurant Brand** (the chain, e.g., "Pizza Hut") and a **Restaurant Branch** (a specific physical location). This allows for robust management of restaurant chains.
    
*   **Shared Menu with Local Availability:** The menu is defined at the **brand** level for consistency. However, a dedicated branch\_menu\_availability table allows each individual branch to manage its own stock and mark items as "available" or "sold out," providing local control.
    
*   **Hybrid Cuisine Model:** The database supports a flexible cuisine system.
    
    *   **Brand Cuisines:** A brand has a default set of cuisines that apply to all its branches.
        
    *   **Branch Cuisines:** An individual branch can optionally add extra, custom cuisines to cater to local tastes.
        

### Ordering & Delivery Flow

*   **Transactional Integrity:** When a user places an order, the system creates a header record in the orders table and detailed line items in the order\_items table.
    
*   **Historical Accuracy:** To ensure records are accurate forever, the order\_items and order\_addresses tables store **snapshots** of the item's name, price, and the delivery address at the exact moment the order was placed. This data will never change, even if the restaurant updates its menu or the user deletes their saved address.
    

### Payments & Promotions

*   **Payment Tracking:** The payments table tracks every payment attempt for an order (pending, successful, or failed), providing a clear audit trail for each transaction.
    
*   **Promotions:** A dedicated Promo Code table allows for the creation and application of discounts to orders. 12121212
    

### Ratings & Reviews

*   **Flexible Feedback System:** A single ratings\_reviews table is used to capture user feedback. It can handle ratings and comments for multiple entity types, including the brand, a specific branch, a delivery agent, or even an individual menu item.
    
*   **Verified Reviews:** The system ensures that only users who have completed an order can leave a review, preventing fake feedback and ensuring data integrity. 13
